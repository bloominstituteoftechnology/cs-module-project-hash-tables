# Equivalent Sums and Differences

This is a tricky one.

We have an ordered set of numbers `q` , which can have any numbers in it
(no duplicates).

Example:

``` math
q = (1, 3, 4, 7, 12)
```

And we have a function `f(x)` , which is defined as:

``` math
f(x) = x * 4 + 6
```

(written algebraically).

The question:

If you choose 4 numbers from `q` , call them `a` , `b` , `c` , and `d` :

What are the combinations of `f(a) + f(b)` that are algebraically
equivalent to the combinations of `f(c) - f(d)` ?

That is, show all `a` , `b` , `c` , `d` for which this is true:

``` math
f(a) + f(b) = f(c) - f(d)
```

For the above `q` , we get this sample output:

``` math
f(1) + f(1) = f(12) - f(7)    10 + 10 = 54 - 34
f(1) + f(4) = f(12) - f(4)    10 + 22 = 54 - 22
f(4) + f(1) = f(12) - f(4)    22 + 10 = 54 - 22
f(1) + f(7) = f(12) - f(1)    10 + 34 = 54 - 10
f(4) + f(4) = f(12) - f(1)    22 + 22 = 54 - 10
f(7) + f(1) = f(12) - f(1)    34 + 10 = 54 - 10
f(3) + f(3) = f(12) - f(3)    18 + 18 = 54 - 18
```

The left column shows the `a` - `d` inputs to `f(x)` , and the right column
shows the result from the what `f(x)` returns for each of those.

No test script for this one. Keep in mind your output might be in a
different order than the above.
